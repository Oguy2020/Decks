            <p>Back from vacation, Github is out
                now and I can finally start documenting.

            <h3>Sorry About Lack Of Documentation, Should Be Adding It Tommorow!</h3>

            <p>Yeah, so the bootloader is FULL
                of comments, making it easier to
                 understand for anyone reading,
                 but i've been real busy over the
                 summer so far, and have mostly
                 spent my OSdev time building the
                 text mode GUI, which should be coming
                 relitivly soon, and the GitHub should
                 be out by tommorow too! I'm going
                 away for the weekend, but I can still
                 give updates and work on the site
                 because I got it on GitHub now, 
                 anyway, bye.

            <h6>8/1/24</h6>
            <p>Looks like it's the first update i've made!
                I built this site over a few hours to document
                the proccess of making this (Please excuse my horrendous
                html/css, by no means am I a web developer). Anyway
                I got C running, which will be the main programming
                laungage I will use!
